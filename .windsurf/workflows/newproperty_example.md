# New Property Addition Workflow

This workflow guides you through adding a new property to the currently open ABL class, following best practices and proper ABL syntax. All necessary code will be generated and inserted into the appropriate location in your class file.

## Interactive Steps

1. **Determine Property Name**
   - Enter a descriptive name for your property (e.g., customerName, orderTotal, isActive)
   - Follow ABL naming conventions (typically camelCase for properties)

2. **Select Property Type**
   - Choose from common ABL data types:
     - CHARACTER: For text values
     - INTEGER: For whole numbers
     - DECIMAL: For numbers with decimal places
     - LOGICAL: For true/false values
     - DATE: For date values
     - DATETIME: For date and time values
     - DATETIME-TZ: For date, time and timezone values
     - Class name: For object references (e.g., CustomerEntity)

3. **Select Property Access Level for GET**
   - PUBLIC: Readable from anywhere
   - PROTECTED: Readable only from the class and its subclasses
   - PACKAGE-PROTECTED: Readable from within the class, any class within its package, and from within any subclass
   - PACKAGE-PRIVATE: Readable only from within the class and any class within its package
   - PRIVATE: Readable only from within the class

4. **Select Property Access Level for SET**
   - PUBLIC: Writable from anywhere
   - PROTECTED: Writable only from the class and its subclasses
   - PACKAGE-PROTECTED: Writable from within the class, any class within its package, and from within any subclass
   - PACKAGE-PRIVATE: Writable from within the class and any class within its package
   - PRIVATE: Writable only from within the class (recommended for encapsulation)
   - NONE: Read-only property (no setter)

5. **Is Property Static?**
   - YES: Property belongs to the class, not instances (use STATIC keyword)
   - NO: Each instance has its own copy of the property (most common)

6. **Need Custom Accessor Logic?**
   - YES: Include custom logic in getter/setter (will use METHOD-based implementation)
   - NO: Use simple property accessors (will use native property syntax)

## Code Generation

Based on your answers, one of the following code patterns will be generated and inserted into the appropriate location in your class:

### Simple Property (No Custom Logic)

```abl
/* [PropertyName] property */
DEFINE [GET-ACCESS-LEVEL] [STATIC] PROPERTY [propertyName] AS [TYPE] 
    GET.
    [SET-ACCESS-LEVEL] SET.
```

For a read-only property:

```abl
/* [PropertyName] property (read-only) */
DEFINE [GET-ACCESS-LEVEL] [STATIC] PROPERTY [propertyName] AS [TYPE] 
    GET.
```

### Property with Custom Logic

```abl
/* [PropertyName] property - private backing field */
VAR PRIVATE [STATIC] [TYPE] m_[propertyName].

/* [PropertyName] property */
DEFINE [GET-ACCESS-LEVEL] [STATIC] PROPERTY [propertyName] AS [TYPE] 
    GET():
        RETURN m_[propertyName].
    END GET.
    [SET-ACCESS-LEVEL] SET(INPUT value AS [TYPE]):
        [VALIDATION_CODE]
        m_[propertyName] = value.
    END SET.
```

## Best Practices

- Group property declarations at the top of the class
- Use ABL's native property syntax for simple properties
- Only use custom accessors when you need validation or special logic
- Consider making properties read-only when appropriate
- Use private setters for properties that should only be modified internally
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Consider using tracking-changes when updating data in a temp-table
- Make sure public methods don't need class context
